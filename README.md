# Data Science Admissions Challenge
## About the Project

Using Python and a Jupyter Notebook, you’re going to explore a data set of over 40,000 international football matches! Don’t worry if you’ve never used Python before, this is a great project for beginners and we’ll provide you with all the resources you need to be successful 💪🏽

## Getting Started: Creating a Github Account

You need a Github account in order to download all the necessary files and to submit your final work.

[Click here](https://github.com/) to create a Github account.

## Downloading + Accessing Necessary Files

Once you've created a Github account, you must download this repository to your local drive.
> Click on the green button that says "Code" > Download ZIP

Unzip the folder. You should have the following files downloaded:
1. [Project Submission Notebook](https://github.com/journey-education/ds-admissions-challenge/blob/master/Project%20Submission.ipynb): This is the .ipynb notebook that you need to submit
2. The [results.csv](https://github.com/journey-education/ds-admissions-challenge/blob/master/results.csv) dataset. This is the csv file that you will analyze
   
## Tools
Anaconda Navigator (the graphical user interface that comes with the Anaconda distribution of Python) is what you will use to access, create, edit and execute Jupyter Notebooks.

[Click here to install Anaconda Navigator.](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

## Project Submission

When you're done, submit your notebook through Github following these steps: 
1. Create a new **public** repository on your account. It's important that the repository is public.
2. Upload your completed **Project Submission notebook** into this repository.
3. Send the Github link to the .ipynb Project Submission notebook to your contact person by the given deadline.

## Submission Requirements
1. Your submission has to be in the form of a .ipynb notebook.
2. Use the provided Project Submission notebook.
3. Make sure that you run all cells with code in your notebook before submitting.
4. Clean up your notebook, and only leave code required to answer the questions.
